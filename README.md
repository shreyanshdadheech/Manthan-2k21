# 2021 Indian Manthan Hackathon Project: Tracking IP Address Behind VPN

## Introduction


I led my team in 2021 and proposed an innovative idea that was selected for the grand finale of the Indian Manthan Hackathon. Our project aimed at tracking 
the IP address behind VPN and was based on the principles of information theory. The theory states that with just a few bits of information about a person,
it is possible to locate them anywhere in the world.


## Project Details

Our project focuses on VPN identification and information theory to reduce the number of individuals to be investigated. By knowing the operating system (OS) being used, such as macOS, which is mostly run by MacBook, and identifying the number of MacBook users, we can significantly narrow down the list of suspects. Additionally, by identifying the user agent, such as Chrome, we can further reduce the number of individuals to be investigated.


## Technologies Used

The project is written in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP and utilizes a combination of these technologies to achieve its goals.


## Key Features

- VPN identification
- Information theory-based approach to locating individuals
- Utilization of operating system and user agent information to narrow down the list of suspects
- Integration of multiple technologies such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP


## Conclusion

In conclusion, our project is a unique and innovative solution to the problem of tracking IP addresses behind VPN. By utilizing information theory and integrating multiple technologies, we have created a solution that is both efficient and effective in locating individuals. We believe that our project has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of network security and privacy.
